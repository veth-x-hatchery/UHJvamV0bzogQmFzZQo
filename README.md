# Pipelines of continuous integration and delivery

We'll see some possibilities of automation to release delivery to different environments, like development, tests, and production.

We integrate with Google Play (with release promotions, to internal, beta, and alpha). With the Apple Play Store and Test Flight. And, sure, with the Firebase App Distribution.

We'll also see ways to keep private keys, certificates, profiles, credentials, secrets securely stored - for each of our environments - and how to replace these parameters automatically, accordingly with our pipeline execution.

We'll talk about cloud providers like Bitrise, Codemagic, or even on-premise solutions like Jenkins and Fastlane.

# Flavors

We'll see an excellent way of implementation of Flavors to iOS and Android. How to define dynamically, at compile-time, properties like "bundle and package id" application name, and whatever else was a need.

So we will have, among other possibilities, for example, two different versions of the same product: A tests version with a different name, and a production version, both on the same smartphone.

# Architecture

We will see the implementation of the concepts from Domain-Driven Design, Clean Architecture, Test Driven Development, and good practices in code writing.

# State Management

We will focus on decoupling business rules, state managers, and visual components of the application. So we can choose the state manager regardless of our architecture.

# Localizations

We will see strategies to translate texts from our domain to our visual components, decoupling between layers.

# Safe Local Storage

We'll look at the possibilities for securely storing sensitive data with iOS and Android security levels.

# Local Authentication

We also have biometric authentication with some business requirements.

# Tests

We have over 90% test coverage, in addition to integration tests, with screenshots automation.
